# Week 10: Team-Builder Assignment for BootCamp

Team Builder Project

Description
This repository contains a team builder application. The team builder application is a NODE CLI that takes user input about employees and generates an HTML file that displays cards for each employee. 
This project utilized HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Node.js and BootStrap for responsive design.

Usage
The application will prompt a user for information about employees. The user can input any number of employees in team roles including manager, engineer, and intern. The application also validates user input. When the user has completed building the team, the application creates an output directory and output file (or overwrites the already existing output directory and output file). The HTML output file displays a formatted team roster, with each employee on their own card, based on the employee data captured from the user.

Tests
Unit tests were also run and all passed (see npmRunTestCapture image). 

Demo
Demo videos and GIF are also included in the repo, along with an output image capture of an example of the final HTML output page.
